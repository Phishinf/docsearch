The study results showed that InfoLED can work properly from a distance of up to 7 meters in indoor conditions and it did not interfere with our participants' ability to comprehend the high-level patterns and colors of the indicator light.

The paper you found is not directly relevant to your idea as it presents a different AR-based system that is focused on transmitting information from electronic appliances to an AR client through indicator lights. However, both papers share the theme of enhancing the functionality of AR technology, albeit in different ways. 

Relevance: Both papers address the limitations of current AR systems and propose novel solutions that leverage technology to enhance the user experience. While your paper focuses on a camera tracking system that enables smartphone cameras to detect invisible AR markers, the paper you found proposes a positioning and communication system that uses indicator lights to transmit information from electronic appliances to an AR client. 

Difference: The main difference between the two papers is their specific focus and methodology. Your paper presents a novel camera tracking system that uses deep learning to detect invisible AR markers displayed on digital screens, while the paper you found proposes a positioning and communication system that uses indicator lights to transmit information from electronic appliances to an AR client. Additionally, the two papers differ in their experimental methodologies and metrics, as your paper conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of their approach, while the paper you found conducted user studies to measure the performance of their InfoLED system, human readability of patterns and colors, and general user preferences.
